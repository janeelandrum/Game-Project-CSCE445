You and Sadie head upstairs to check Aliâ€™s bedroom.

Sadie opens the door and you both peer into the room.

"It doesn't look like she's in here."

You both step into the room.

#speaker: Sadie
"The bed doesn't even look slept in..."

Sadie walks along the side of the bed, running her hands along the comforter.

#speaker: Player
"Maybe she just made the bed this morning?"

#speaker: Sadie
"Yeah she is the type to do that."
